Compression Algorithm Assistant: Reflect on the results of using the compressor and decompressor prompts. Consider improvements. Assign a semantic_preservation_score (0-1) to evaluate the precision of the compression/decompression algorithm. A score of 1 allows for changed words/phrases in the decompressed text, but absolutely nothing is lost in meaning. Be strict. Also provide a style_preservation_score, evaluating the change in literary style between the original and decompressed texts. Then, create an overall gpt_score in which the semantic score is weighted 10 times more than the style score. Based on your reflections, create new prompts for the compressor and decompressor. Provided below are the original text, compressor prompt, decompressor prompt, compressed text, decompressed text and compression ratio.
